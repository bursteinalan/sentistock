HER CHILDREN AND MANY LOVED ONES GATHERED AROUND HER IN LOVING MEMORY. WE ARE BLESSED THAT UP UNTIL HER DEATH, SHE WAS HAPPILY ACTIVE AND ENGAGED WITH HER FAMILY, BELOVED FRIENDS AND INTERESTS. THROUGHOUT HER LIFE, OUR MOTHER WAS A CONSTANT INSPIRATION AND SOURCE OF PROFOUND LOVE AND WISDOM FOR HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS. OUR MOTHER CARED DEEPLY ABOUT HER FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND THE WELL BEING OF OTHERS. DURING WORLD WAR II, SHE SERVED IN THE AMERICAN WOMEN'S VOLUNTEER SERVICE AND ALSO SERVED AS A NURSE'S AIDE IN THE PHILADELPHIA NAVAL HOSPITAL ASSISTING THE WOUNDED. SHE HAD A KEEN INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING AND SPENDING TIME WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLES AND CULTURES. SHE WORKED QUIETLY TO PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND HAD AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO GENERATE UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT AMONG PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND VIEWS. AS FIRST LADY OF NEW YORK AND SECOND LADY OF THE UNITED STATES AND AS A CONCERNED AND INTERESTED CITIZEN, SHE VISITED ALL PARTS OF THE GLOBE. SHE WAS APPOINTED TO TWO TERMS AS A PUBLIC DELEGATE TO THE UNITED NATIONS BY PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH IN 1991 AND 1992, SERVING UNDER US AMBASSADOR THOMAS PICKERING. AFTER HER SERVICE, SHE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE HER COUNTRY'S INTERESTS THERE AND HOST IMPORTANT GATHERINGS. SHE HAD A DEEP LOVE OF LEARNING AND READ THROUGHOUT HER LIFE HISTORICAL NOVELS AND HISTORY. SHE WAS PROUD OF HOW HER HERITAGE AND HER FAMILY HAD HELPED AMERICA OVER THE YEARS. HER GREAT, GREAT, GRANDFATHER, GENERAL GEORGE MEADE, WAS COMMANDER OF THE UNION ARMY AT THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG. SHE WAS THE GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER OF EDWIN H. FITLER, FORMER MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA. AND SHE WAS ALSO DESCENDED FROM JONATHAN DICKENSON, THE FOUNDER OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, AND JOSEPH HARRISON, WHO BUILT THE RAILROADS IN RUSSIA UNDER TSAR NICHOLAS II. AS A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR ENDURING TWO MASTECTOMIES SHORTLY AFTER HER HUSBAND NELSON ROCKEFELLER BECAME VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SHE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE, ALONG WITH FIRST LADY BETTY FORD, IN HELPING PEOPLE GAIN A GREATER AWARENESS OF BREAST CANCER AND ITS DETECTION.

ROOSEVELT FOUR FREEDOMS PARK IN NEW YORK CITY, THE CENTRAL PARK CONSERVANCY, THE ROCKEFELLER STATE PARK PRESERVE, AND SERVED ON THE BOARD OF HISTORIC HUDSON VALLEY AND AS A TRUSTEE OF THE ROCKEFELLER BROTHERS FUND. SHE SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE SARATOGA PERFORMING ARTS CENTER (SPAC) FROM ITS FORMATION IN 1966 UNTIL 1973 AND WAS NAMED AS HONORARY CHAIRPERSON FOR SPAC'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION IN 2016. AS A MOTHER SHE GUIDED US WITH HER STEADFAST LOVE AND THOUGHTFUL INSIGHTS AND UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE AND THE WORLD. SHE TAUGHT US THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND COUNTRY. SHE SHARED WITH US HER DEEP LOVE OF NATURE FROM WHICH SHE DREW STRENGTH AND SPIRITUALITY. SHE DELIGHTED IN FEEDING BIRDS AND WILDLIFE NEAR HER HOME. FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS SHE WAS A DEDICATED SWIMMER NEARLY EVERY DAY. SHE DEEPLY ENJOYED TAKING LONG WALKS WITH LOVED ONES AS OFTEN AS SHE COULD. MOM WAS A KIND AND GIVING WOMAN, WHO LEFT US WITH LOVING MEMORIES THAT WILL REMAIN FOREVER. OUR MOTHER, ABOVE ALL, WAS DEDICATED TO HER IMMEDIATE AND EXTENDED FAMILY AND TO MANY DEAR FRIENDS. SHE GREATLY LOVED SPENDING TIME WITH HER CHILDREN, INCLUDING MALINDA MENOTTI WHO PASSED AWAY IN 2005, AND FOURTEEN GRANDCHILDREN. SHE HAD A FIRM BELIEF IN THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY AND THE NURTURING, SUPPORT, AND PERSPECTIVE IT PROVIDES. ON TUESDAY, JUNE 9 THERE WILL BE A PRIVATE FUNERAL WITH FAMILY AND CLOSE FRIENDS. IN SEPTEMBER THERE WILL BE A MEMORIAL CELEBRATION OF HER LIFE. WE GREATLY MISS HER AND WE WILL ALWAYS BE GUIDED BY HER WISDOM AND LOVE. THE CHILDREN OF MRS. NELSON A. ""HAPPY"" ROCKEFELLER; JAMES B. MURPHY, WENDY M. BICKFORD, CAROL M. LYDEN, NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER, JR., MARK F. ROCKEFELLER. 1"

HER CHILDREN AND MANY LOVED ONES GATHERED AROUND HER IN LOVING MEMORY. WE ARE BLESSED THAT UP UNTIL HER DEATH, SHE WAS HAPPILY ACTIVE AND ENGAGED WITH HER FAMILY, BELOVED FRIENDS AND INTERESTS. THROUGHOUT HER LIFE, OUR MOTHER WAS A CONSTANT INSPIRATION AND SOURCE OF PROFOUND LOVE AND WISDOM FOR HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS. OUR MOTHER CARED DEEPLY ABOUT HER FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND THE WELL BEING OF OTHERS. DURING WORLD WAR II, SHE SERVED IN THE AMERICAN WOMEN'S VOLUNTEER SERVICE AND ALSO SERVED AS A NURSE'S AIDE IN THE PHILADELPHIA NAVAL HOSPITAL ASSISTING THE WOUNDED. SHE HAD A KEEN INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING AND SPENDING TIME WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLES AND CULTURES. SHE WORKED QUIETLY TO PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND HAD AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO GENERATE UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT AMONG PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND VIEWS. AS FIRST LADY OF NEW YORK AND SECOND LADY OF THE UNITED STATES AND AS A CONCERNED AND INTERESTED CITIZEN, SHE VISITED ALL PARTS OF THE GLOBE. SHE WAS APPOINTED TO TWO TERMS AS A PUBLIC DELEGATE TO THE UNITED NATIONS BY PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH IN 1991 AND 1992, SERVING UNDER US AMBASSADOR THOMAS PICKERING. AFTER HER SERVICE, SHE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE HER COUNTRY'S INTERESTS THERE AND HOST IMPORTANT GATHERINGS. SHE HAD A DEEP LOVE OF LEARNING AND READ THROUGHOUT HER LIFE HISTORICAL NOVELS AND HISTORY. SHE WAS PROUD OF HOW HER HERITAGE AND HER FAMILY HAD HELPED AMERICA OVER THE YEARS. HER GREAT, GREAT, GRANDFATHER, GENERAL GEORGE MEADE, WAS COMMANDER OF THE UNION ARMY AT THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG. SHE WAS THE GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER OF EDWIN H. FITLER, FORMER MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA. AND SHE WAS ALSO DESCENDED FROM JONATHAN DICKENSON, THE FOUNDER OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, AND JOSEPH HARRISON, WHO BUILT THE RAILROADS IN RUSSIA UNDER TSAR NICHOLAS II. AS A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR ENDURING TWO MASTECTOMIES SHORTLY AFTER HER HUSBAND NELSON ROCKEFELLER BECAME VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SHE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE, ALONG WITH FIRST LADY BETTY FORD, IN HELPING PEOPLE GAIN A GREATER AWARENESS OF BREAST CANCER AND ITS DETECTION. HER CHARITABLE INTERESTS INCLUDED HEARTFELT SUPPORT FOR THE PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA AND ITS ANNUAL VISITS TO CHINA AND THE ORCHESTRA'S MISSION OF PROMOTING INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING. SHE SUPPORTED THE FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT FOUR FREEDOMS PARK IN NEW YORK CITY, THE CENTRAL PARK CONSERVANCY, THE ROCKEFELLER STATE PARK PRESERVE, AND SERVED ON THE BOARD OF HISTORIC HUDSON VALLEY AND AS A TRUSTEE OF THE ROCKEFELLER BROTHERS FUND. SHE SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE SARATOGA PERFORMING ARTS CENTER (SPAC) FROM ITS FORMATION IN 1966 UNTIL 1973 AND WAS NAMED AS HONORARY CHAIRPERSON FOR SPAC'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION IN 2016. AS A MOTHER SHE GUIDED US WITH HER STEADFAST LOVE AND THOUGHTFUL INSIGHTS AND UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE AND THE WORLD. SHE TAUGHT US THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND COUNTRY. SHE SHARED WITH US HER DEEP LOVE OF NATURE FROM WHICH SHE DREW STRENGTH AND SPIRITUALITY. SHE DELIGHTED IN FEEDING BIRDS AND WILDLIFE NEAR HER HOME. FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS SHE WAS A DEDICATED SWIMMER NEARLY EVERY DAY. SHE DEEPLY ENJOYED TAKING LONG WALKS WITH LOVED ONES AS OFTEN AS SHE COULD. MOM WAS A KIND AND GIVING WOMAN, WHO LEFT US WITH LOVING MEMORIES THAT WILL REMAIN FOREVER. OUR MOTHER, ABOVE ALL, WAS DEDICATED TO HER IMMEDIATE AND EXTENDED FAMILY AND TO MANY DEAR FRIENDS. SHE GREATLY LOVED SPENDING TIME WITH HER CHILDREN, INCLUDING MALINDA MENOTTI WHO PASSED AWAY IN 2005, AND FOURTEEN GRANDCHILDREN. SHE HAD A FIRM BELIEF IN THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY AND THE NURTURING, SUPPORT, AND PERSPECTIVE IT PROVIDES. ON TUESDAY, JUNE 9 THERE WILL BE A PRIVATE FUNERAL WITH FAMILY AND CLOSE FRIENDS. IN SEPTEMBER THERE WILL BE A MEMORIAL CELEBRATION OF HER LIFE. WE GREATLY MISS HER AND WE WILL ALWAYS BE GUIDED BY HER WISDOM AND LOVE. THE CHILDREN OF MRS. NELSON A. ""HAPPY"" ROCKEFELLER; JAMES B.
