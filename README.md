Social media sentiment to stock market volatility

## Datasets
- https://github.com/shaypal5/awesome-twitter-data

## TODO
- [x] NN
- [ ] More recent data for twitter and news (the data is all stale)
- [ ] Combine the related mediums into separate regressors/classifiers (somewhat ready)
- [ ] Higher granularity stock data (LOW)
- [ ] Create a heuristic including bag of words for topics (I.e apple) (MED)
- [ ] Try Fixed Effects Entity with multiple class (MED)
- [ ] Fixed Effects Regression of some sort (started, but doesnâ€™t work for me without entities, IMPORTANT)
- [ ] Combine all data together for one super classier/regressor (IMPORTANT)
- [ ] Back Testing Model to see actual profit on blinded data (IMPORTANT)
