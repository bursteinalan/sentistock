THAT IS THE SENTIMENT MOST COMMONLY EXPRESSED BY THE MANY PEOPLE WHO LOVED HUNT COLE. GRACIOUS, ELEGANT, KIND, AND WITTY, HUNT OFTEN OPENED HIS HOME TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY, HOSTING CONVIVIAL DINNERS AND ENTERTAINING GUESTS AT THE PIANO. HUNT AND HIS LONGTIME PARTNER ISADORE FROM (DIED 1994) HAD FRIENDS ALL OVER, FROM EUROPE TO L.A. TO THE WEST VILLAGE. THEY ADORED THEIR HOME IN THE DORDOGNE REGION OF FRANCE, WHERE THEY SPENT THE SUMMER EVERY YEAR. A LIFELONG LOVER OF WORDS, HUNT STARTED OUT AS A REPORTER FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE AFTER GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE, AND WENT ON TO BE A LONGTIME INDEPENDENT BOOK EDITOR, WORKING CHIEFLY FOR MCGRAW, HILL IN NEW YORK. HE HAD PASSIONS FOR THEATER AND FILM, WHICH HE CARRIED INTO HIS TWILIGHT YEARS, ALONG WITH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACTING, DIRECTING, SINGING, AND READING. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, HE WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED PIANIST, SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO DAILY. AT HOME ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE, HE LIVED AMONGST THE THINGS HE LOVED BEST: BOOKS, A GRAND PIANO, AND A READY KITCHEN. HE WILL BE DEEPLY MISSED AND WILL REMAIN, ALWAYS, IN OUR HEARTS. BORN IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA, HUNT WAS A LONGTIME RESIDENT OF NEW YORK CITY, A GRADUATE OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY, AND A VETERAN OF THE COAST GUARD. HE IS SURVIVED BY HIS BROTHER, JOHN COLE, FOUR NIECES, AND THREE NEPHEWS. 1"
