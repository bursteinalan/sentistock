SHE WAS 91, BORN ON JANUARY 24, 1924, IN WARSAW, POLAND TO ISADORE AND NORMA SLOTNIK. MITZI WAS A GREAT SOURCE OF KINDNESS, LOVE, AND STRENGTH FOR FIVE GENERATIONS OF HER FAMILY. UP UNTIL HER LAST DAY, SHE WORKED AS THE OFFICE MANAGER AND BOOKKEEPER FOR A MEDICAL PRACTICE IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN. SHE WAS A GRADUATE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL IN BROOKLYN. SHE WAS MARRIED AND DIVORCED TWICE, AND HER DAUGHTER RONNIE WAS THE CHILD OF HER FIRST MARRIAGE TO DAVID POLLINGER. MITZI LOVED NEW YORK CITY AND FOR MORE THAN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS LIVED ON WEST 11TH STREET IN THE HEART OF GREENWICH VILLAGE. SHE LOVED JAZZ, THE METROPOLITAN OPERA, FASHION, JEWISH FAMILY LIFE, AND COLLECTED FRIENDS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. SHE HAD AN ADDICTIVE LAUGH; HER ABILITY TO FIND THE HUMOR IN LIFE WAS REMARKABLE. SHE ENTHUSIASTICALLY WELCOMED FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS, FROM TORONTO TO JERUSALEM, TO STAY WITH HER ON VISITS TO NEW YORK. AS THE MATRIARCH OF HER LARGE EXTENDED FAMILY, SHE SERVED AS THE CENTRAL CONNECTION AND INFORMATION BANK AMONG NUMEROUS FAMILY MEMBERS WHO IMPARTED PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL UPDATES, RELYING ON MITZI TO DISSEMINATE THE NEWS. SHE WAS BELOVED FOR HER PASSIONATE LOYALTY AND DEVOTION TO HER FAMILY, AND WAS ALWAYS PROUD OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BUT DID NOT HESITATE TO GIVE STRAIGHTFORWARD ADVICE WHEN WARRANTED. SHE WAS TRUSTED BY ALL BECAUSE SHE COULD KEEP A SECRET. SHE IS SURVIVED BY HER LOVING DAUGHTER, RONNIE BARBACK AND HER HUSBAND SPENCER; GRANDDAUGHTER, REBECCA ROBAN AND HER HUSBAND KEN; GRANDSON, MICHAEL KANNER AND HIS WIFE LISA; ADORING FOUR GREAT, GRANDCHILDREN, DANIELLE AND MATTHEW ROBAN AND REX AND MADISON KANNER; THREE BROTHERS, JACK SLOTNICK, AND FRED AND SOL SLOTNIK; AND THRONGS OF NIECES AND NEPHEWS. FOR EVERY MEMBER OF HER EXTENDED FAMILY AND HER MANY FRIENDS, THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER MITZI. SHE WILL BE GREATLY MISSED AND ALWAYS REMEMBERED. 1"
